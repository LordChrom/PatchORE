## PatchORE
This fixes things. Said things were either "broken" or a big nuissance on our creative network.

##### Current fixes:
* Evil spawn eggs
* Death potions
* Pre-extended pistons
* Illegal packets when entering the void
* Firework restrictions
* Enchantment restrictions

Special thanks to [StackDoubleFlow](https://github.com/StackDoubleFlow) for [putting together the patch for illegal void packets](https://github.com/StackDoubleFlow/IHateTheVoid).
